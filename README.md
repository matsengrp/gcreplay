### description of metadata files (metadata.PR1.csv and petadata.PR2.csv)
These files describe the properties of each GC, e.g. timepoint, mouse, etc. At the moment, they're separate since they came from different sources, but should probably be merged at some point.

  - the w10 (week 10) samples used lymph node (LN) sampling rather than GC sampling because there weren't any GCs big enough to find (GC number for these is arbitrary, at the moment it's just sampling order)                                                                                                    

###### samples labeled "lmp2a"
  - LMP2a mice had LMP2A protein from virus inserted into one of the D regions of the VH locus
  - So the B cell expresses LMP2A and chigy-H from the other VH locus
  - Effect is that LMP2A providing weak constitutively active B cell signaling (tonic signal)
  - We thought that this might provide B cells that have nonsense mutations with enough B cell signals to survive
  - If this was the case it would’ve been consistent with a hypothesis that there might be a checkpoint from leaving the dark zone to enter the right zone (ie having receptors on surface)
  - but we found no evidence of that, meaning LMP2A GCs didn’t increase B cells with stop codon
  - In fact it might have increased B cells with affinity increases (more efficient affinity maturation?) but don’t remember if there was statistical significance
