# Passenger allele analysis

## Notebooks that make final plots
* `igh_passenger_aggregate.ipynb`
* `igk_passenger_aggregate.ipynb`

## Processing notebooks and code
* `passenger-8a.ipynb`
* `passenger-9a.ipynb`
* `passenger-11a.ipynb`
* `passenger-igh.ipynb`
* `passenger.py`

## Key directories
* `input`: where input files should go to replicate analysis
* `output`: output files
* `passenger-blast`: where we use BLAST to identify sequences that come from passenger allele
