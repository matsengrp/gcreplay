# Germinal Center Replay Analysis & Results 

Here we present some useful reference materials for the analysis of the GC Replay data. 

For complete computational pipeline see our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/matsengrp/gcreplay)

* [Key Files](https://matsen.group/gcreplay/key-files/) outlines the source code for figures seen in our manuscript, as well as descriptions of the pipeline input, intermediate, and results files that are available to download.
* [Mutation heatmaps](https://matsen.group/gcreplay/interactive-figures/mutation-heatmaps/naive_reversions_first.html) for browsing mutational effects as measured both across both Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS), and replay data.
* [Tree Visualizations](https://matsen.group/gcreplay/tree-visualizations/) for browsing the phylogenetic trees generated from the B-cell receptor sequences.
* **Analysis (Notebooks)** for a summary of the analysis performed downstream from BCR isolation, and phylogenetic inference.
* **Supplementary** for the results we generated with different parameters to the `gctree` inference step
* [Nextflow Pipeline](https://matsen.group/gcreplay/pipeline-details/) for a description of the pipeline used to process the data, and generate the results.
