# Germinal Center Replay Analysis & Results 

Here we present some useful reference materials for the analysis of the GC Replay data. 
The protocol and analysis were a collaborative effort between the 
[Victora](https://www.germinal.center/) and 
[Matsen](https://matsen.fhcrc.org/) labs.
For question and inquiries, please contact [X]()

* **Key Files** for a brief description of the pipeline input, intermediate, and results files that are available to download.
* **Mutation heatmaps** for browsing mutational effects as measured both across both Deep Mutational Scanning (DMS), and replay data.
* **Tree Visualizations** for browsing the phylogenetic trees generated from the B-cell receptor sequences.
* **Analysis (Notebooks)** for a summary of the analysis performed downstream from BCR isolation, and phylogenetic inference.
* **Supplementary** for the results we generated with different parameters to the `gctree` inference step
* **Nextflow Pipeline** for a description of the pipeline used to process the data, and generate the results.
